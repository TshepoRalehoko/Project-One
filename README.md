# Project-One

**Description**: This is a personal project. The project deals with the 'popular' *Credit* dataset. A brief description of the dataset is provided. The aim of the project is to build the best model for predicting the output variable, using all, or a subset of the features. On that note, we wish to indicate that the dataset we shall be dealing with falls into the *supervised learning* paradigm. For assessing the accuracy of the models in predicting the corresponding *target* variable, we will generate and utilize the necessary *goodness of fit* statistics. We will also keep an eye of the *bias-variance trade-off* during the model building process. This concept is explained in detail under the **Data Modelling** section. Furthermore, we want to underscore that the project is for learning purposes, and as a result, any constructive input is appreciated.
