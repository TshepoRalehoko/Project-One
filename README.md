# Project-One

Description: This is a personal project. The project deals with the well-known \textit{Credit} dataset. A brief description of the dataset shall follow. The aim of the project is to build the best model for predicting the output variable using, all or a subset of the features. On that note, we wish to indicate that the dataset we shall be dealing with falls into the \textit{supervised learning} paradigm. For assessing the accuracy of the models in predicting the corresponding \textit{target} variable, we will generate and utilize the necessary \textit{goodness of fit} statistics. We will also keep an eye of the \textit{bias-variance trade-off} during the model building process. This concept is explained in detail under the \textbf{Data Modelling} section. Furthermore, we want to underscore that the project is for learning purposes, and as a result, any constructive input is appreciate.
